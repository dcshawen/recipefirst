The Data Layer has been implemented! Schema designed, test data inserted, SQL queries defined… Everything tested for pass and fail conditions and everything worked as expected.
## Retrospective

Progress was slow at the start but after a push at the end (or 'sprint'… if you will…) I managed to close all of the outstanding tickets. This is good news, but not without the small caveat that it would have been better news if the work progress had been consistent across the duration of the sprint.

But that's just the way software development goes, isn't it?
## Going Forward

I would like to be more consistent about my progress in future sprints. That can be easier-said-than-done though. I only really have consistent time to do work on the weekends and that's assuming I can pull myself away from just relaxing. Going to just have to be more disciplined about blocking off time on the weekends to do work.

It would also be nice to be able to dedicate at least an hour a night to working on this during the week. That isn't much time but it'll keep my head in the game, at least.
### Next Sprint - Presentation Layer

Originally the plan was to build Recipe First from the bottom up -- Data Layer -> Logic Layer -> Presentation Layer -- but besides the relatively small size of the Logic Layer compared to the Data and Presentation Layer, I've had to implement parts of the logic layer just to get the data layer working.

I may need to restructure my plans. The Logic Layer may not need to have a Sprint for itself and it can just be implemented as part of the Data Layer and Presentation Layer Sprints. Maybe if there's anything left at the end we can dedicate some time to the Logic Layer.

So yeah, tomorrow we start the Presentation Layer.
