# Notes
- Supports multiple inventories
- Pantries should be optionally shared between user profiles
	- Users should be able to both have their own private pantries as well as communal pantries for family or roommates-that-share situations (or team environments, or work kitchens, etc.)
	- Permission based -- Pantries can have Users added to them. To share a pantry simply create it and then add any members of your household/team to give them access.
